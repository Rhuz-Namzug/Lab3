                <div id="subcontent">
                    <h3>- TFT is an “autochess” game that recently celebrated 
                        its 6th birthday! As time has passed, more mechanics have been 
                        added to the game, making it difficult for new players to pick up.
                        <br>
                        <br>- The ultimate goal of TFT is to be the last player standing in an 8-player free for all match.
                        You spend the game accumulating resources like gold and items and making decisions 
                        to build a team of units with different strengths, weaknesses, and abilities.
                        <br>
                        <br>-If you compose your team with units that synergize, they will be empowered with buffed properties.
                         Your team of units will fight against the teams of the other players at random during the rounds. 
                        The player whose team loses will take damage. When a player runs out of life, they are out. 
                        This may seem hard but getting top 4 counts as a win, so aim for that.
                    <br>
